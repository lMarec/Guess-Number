## About
Guess-Number is a small, command-line game in which the player attempts to guess a number generated by Node.js. The game provides feedback (too low / too high / correct) and offers Easy and Hard modes to change difficulty.

This repository contains the JavaScript needed to run the game in Node.js.

## Features
- Simple, lightweight terminal game (no build step)
- Easy and Hard difficulty modes
- Instant feedback after each guess

## How to play
1. Run the game with Node.js (as described in Getting started).
2. Select a mode (Easy or Hard) if available.
3. Enter a number as your guess and submit.
4. The game will tell you whether your guess is too low, too high, or correct.
5. Repeat until you find the correct number or run out of attempts (Hard Mode only)

Typical interaction:
- Guess -> Get feedback -> Adjust guess -> Repeat

## Game modes & settings
- Easy: Simply keep guessing the number and when you get it right, the number of attempts are logged
- Hard: The number of attempts is limited to 10, if this is reached, the number will be regenerated
