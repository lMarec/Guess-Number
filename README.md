## About
Guess-Number is a small, client-side game in which the player attempts to guess a number generated by the browser. The game provides feedback (too low / too high / correct) and offers Easy and Hard modes to change difficulty.

This repository contains the JavaScript needed to run the game in any modern browser.

## Features
- Simple, lightweight browser game (no build step)
- Easy and Hard difficulty modes
- Instant feedback after each guess
- Works offline after cloning (open index.html)

## Getting started

Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Git (optional, to clone the repository)
- A simple static server if you prefer (optional)

Run locally
1. Clone the repository (or download the ZIP):
      ##
   -       git clone https://github.com/lMarec/Guess-Number.git
   - If git isn't installed on your computer and you're running a Fedora or Debian based distribution, use the below one-liner command to automatically install git and clone this repository. Otherwise, refer to [the git install guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
     ##
           (((sudo apt-get update && sudo apt install git-all) || (sudo dnf install git-all)) && git clone https://github.com/lMarec/Guess-Number.git)
     
2. Open the project folder and open `index.html` in your browser:
   - Double-click `index.html` or open it from the browser `File -> Open`.
3. (Optional) Serve the directory with a static server:
   - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000` then open `http://localhost:8000`
   - Node (http-server): `npx http-server -p 8080` then open `http://localhost:8080`

No build step is required.

## How to play
1. Open the game in a browser.
2. Select a mode (Easy or Hard) if available.
3. Enter a number as your guess and submit.
4. The game will tell you whether your guess is too low, too high, or correct.
5. Repeat until you find the correct number or run out of attempts (Hard Mode only)

Typical interaction:
- Guess -> Get feedback -> Adjust guess -> Repeat

## Game modes & settings
- Easy: Simply keep guessing the number and when you get it right, the number of attempts are logged
- Hard: The number of attempts is limited to 10, if this is reached, the number will be regenerated
